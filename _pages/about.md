I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at The Ohio State University, specializing in morphology and African languages.

My dissertation, titled _Topics in Kihehe Verbal Morphology_, describes the tense-aspect system of Kihehe (Bantu, Tanzania), investigates the erosion of a suffix, and examines how language use attitudes are developing in the area. I am advised by Professor Andrea Sims.

You can find my CV [here](/cv/).

Other things I am involved in:
- compiling a dictionary of Kihehe
- collaborating with Simon Msovela on negation in Kihehe
- looking at change in Iringa Swahili with Hannah Gibson and Teresa Poeta
